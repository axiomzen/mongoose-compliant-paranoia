# Mongoose anti-paranoia

Prevent rails's active record **deleted_at** field from messing your queries by being aware of it.

Meant to work with both mongoid and the active record plugin (#TODO link both)

Inspiration from [https://github.com/Gottox/mongoose-cache/blob/master/lib/cache.js]

## how to dev

Put coffee to run

```
coffee -o lib/ coffee/
```
